### Usage

[iMemex](https://imemex.edening.net) simply needs to be hosted on a writable IPFS gateway. You can easily run it locally or in a distributed way. Not every single application should start their own IPFS gateway regarding performance reasons. Rather you have only one IPFS gateway running on your machine or browser.
