### Features

- Local(IBIPFS) Store First
- Trails Extending Tags
- Classical Web Inclusion

### Install

This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.
To create the index.html simply run:
```
npm run build
```

### Usage

[iMemex](https://imemex.edening.net) simply needs to be hosted on a writable IPFS gateway. You can easily run it locally or in a distributed way. Not every single application should start their own IPFS gateway regarding performance reasons. Rather you have only one IPFS gateway running on your machine or browser.

### Contributing
You can either support this project by setting up an [IPFS Node](#ipfs-node), [donating](#donate) or by contributing to the [code](#code).

### IPFS Nodes Underneath, _provided by `Dweb.page`_
If you wish to participate you can simply [set up your own IPFS node with a writeable gateway](https://blog.florence.chat/tutorial-host-your-own-ipfs-node-and-help-the-next-generation-of-web-2860eb59e45e). You need to allow a maximum upload size on your server of 1GB. Lastly, reach out to us at info[at]pact[dot]care or on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/VMj7PFN) so we then can integrate your side on our main page. Currently, we share the IOTA donations equally among all participants at the end of every month. For transparency, you can track all donations under the current IOTA donation address. In the future, we might set up an advertising model to make it more attractive for IPFS nodes to participate.
